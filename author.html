  		 Ray Bradbury was born on August 22, 1920, in Waukegan, Illinois, to Leonard Spaulding Bradbury, and Ester Moberg Bradbury. 
  		 Bradbury was an American fantasy and horror author who rejected being categorized as a science fiction author, claiming 
  		 that his work was based on the fantastical and unreal. His best known novel is Fahrenheit 451, a dystopian study of future
  		 American society in which critical thought is outlawed. He died in Los Angeles on June 5, 2012, at the age of 91. He became 
  		 an inspiration to writers, teachers and science-fiction enthusiasts, among countless others.
